This is the third group project for the Data Analytics Bootcamp at Ironhack. The goal of this project was to consolidate our knowledge of APIs and web scraping. We decided to develop a sports app that makes live connections to three APIs and has a database of web scraped events.

Group members: Maria Garcia, Giada Sartori and Asier Rodriguez

The app's main features are:
1. Based on your location, the app will show you sports venues nearby to practice the sport you choose.
2. Based on your location, the app will show you the events happening near you sorted by date.
3. Based on your mood or the sport you want to practice, the app will suggest song lists from Spotify to play while you work out. 

All of this has been capable thanks to the following APIs:
- OpenCage geocoding API: https://opencagedata.com
- Decathlon sports places API and Decathlon sports ID Database: https://developers.decathlon.com/products/sport-places/docs
- Spotify web API: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/
- World's Marathons web scraped database: https://worldsmarathons.com/

Sportify is the perfect app for sports lovers! The app will find venues for a specific sport wherever you are, will keep you up to date with the sports events in any city you want to, and will suggest you the perfect playlist from Spotify so you can give it all while you work out!

SPORTIFY, BE ACTIVE ANYWHERE YOU GO!
